  "summary": "The implementation covers all four requirements with excellent fidelity. The notes management system (REQ-1) is fully implemented with CRUD operations in both backend (Motoko) and frontend (React/TypeScript). The to-do list system (REQ-2) is complete with checkboxes, completion toggling, and persistence. The cute aesthetic theme (REQ-3) is thoroughly implemented with pastel colors, rounded corners, soft shadows, playful typography (Nunito font), and hover effects throughout the application. The generated images (REQ-4) are correctly referenced in components and placed in the assets/generated directory. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
