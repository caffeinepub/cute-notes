## Summary
**Goal:** Create a cute aesthetic notes and to-do list application where users can manage notes and tasks with an adorable pastel-themed UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement notes system with create, read, update, and delete functionality (title and content fields)
- Implement to-do list system with add, check/uncheck, and delete functionality
- Design cute aesthetic theme with pastel colors (pinks, lavenders, mint greens, peaches), rounded corners, soft shadows, and playful typography
- Add cute hover effects and adorable UI elements throughout
- Ensure data persistence across sessions for both notes and to-dos
- Include generated decorative images (cloud, star, checkmark icons) in the cute aesthetic

**User-visible outcome:** Users can write and manage notes, create and check off to-do items, all within a cohesive cute pastel-themed interface with adorable visual elements.
